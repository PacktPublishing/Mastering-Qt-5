## Authors
[Guillaume Lazar](https://github.com/GuillaumeLazar) and [Robin Penea](https://github.com/synapticvoid) are software engineers living near Paris in France. They founded NeuronalMotion together in 2014 to implement their vision of entrepreneurship and project development. They aim to achieve a self-organized company.

## Book description
We aim to teach the reader to be proficient with Qt mechanisms to resolve real world problems. We put a strong focus on the latest version of C++14 to see how it can fit with a well designed Qt 5 application.

Here is a summary of the covered topics:
* Create stunning UIs with Qt Widget and Qt Quick
* Develop powerful, cross-platform applications with the Qt framework
* Design GUIs with the Qt Designer and build a library in it for UI preview
* Handle user interaction with the Qt signal/slot mechanism in C++
* Prepare a cross-platform project to host a third-party library
* Build a Qt application using the OpenCV API
* Use the Qt Animation framework to display stunning effects
* Deploy mobile apps with Qt and embedded platforms

## Technical instructions
* All the code in this book can be compiled and run from Qt Creator using Qt 5.7. You can do it from your preferred OS: Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.
* About the mobile-specific chapters, either an Android or an iOS device works, but it is not mandatory (the simulator/emulator can be enough).
* Chapter 6, Even Qt deserves a slice of Raspberry Pi, offers to build an application running on a Raspberry Pi. Although it is more fun if we can do it with a real Raspberry Pi, it is not necessary to have one to complete the chapter.

## Errata
Official Packt errata page is https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/support/25651

### Chapter 2
* Add charts in .pro file, page 49/54/58 (paper book)
  * Your QT module import should be "QT += core gui charts"
  * Check the file [ch02-sysinfo.pro](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5/blob/master/Chapter_02/ch02-sysinfo.pro)
* The MainWindow must define a QHBoxLayout
  * The application will crash with no layout in MainWindow
  * You can update your MainWindow.ui like this [MainWindow.ui](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5/blob/master/Chapter_02/MainWindow.ui) 
  * Or you can add "ui->centralWidget->setLayout(new QHBoxLayout());" in the MainWindow constructor
  * Check this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42353352/sigsegv-when-adding-widget-in-qt) on StackOverflow
* CpuWidget typo, page 63 (paper book)
  * "we have to include the Q_OBJECT macro to allow **CpuWidget**" (not CPUWidget)
* Run the application too soon, page 65 (paper book)
  * "If you run the pplication, you should see something like this", in fact you can't run the application at this step because CpuWidget::updateSeries() is a pure virual function and we implement the body function at the page 66!
  * Page 46, there is a typo the Windows structure name, is is `FILETIME` and not `FILEFTIME`
  * Page 47, in the second bullet point, the sentence should be "The second one is retrieved when the `cpuRawData()` function is called

### Chapter 5
* Cache issue in PictureImageProvider::pictureFromCache(), page 189 (paper book)
  * Replace "mPicturesCache.contains(pictureSize)" by "mPicturesCache.contains(key)"
  * Replace "mPicturesCache[pictureSize]" by "mPicturesCache[key]"
  * Check the updated file [PictureImageProvider.cpp](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5/blob/master/Chapter_05/gallery-mobile/PictureImageProvider.cpp)

### Chapter 6
* Qt3D API instability
  * Due to some changes of the Qt3D module from Qt 5.7, the code has been updated and tested for Qt 5.10.1
   * Check this [commit](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Qt-5/commit/06e3493a3c27a2211317f4bdb6e8c40a5c2d9982)

### Chapter 12
* Executing your tests
  * Page 435 (ebook) or page 444 (paperbook),The correct include is: #include "testjsonserializer.moc"

## Chapters description
### Chapter 1, Get Your Qt Feet Wet
Lays the fundamentals of Qt and refreshes your memory with a todo application. This chapter covers the Qt project structure, how to use the designer, basic principles of the signals and slots mechanism, and introduces new features of C++14.

### Chapter 2, Discovering QMake Secrets
Takes a deep dive in the heart of the Qt compilation system: qmake. This chapter will help you understand how it works, how to use it, and how you can structure a Qt application with platform-specific code by designing a system monitoring application.

### Chapter 3, Dividing Your Project and Ruling Your Code 
Analyzes the Qt model/view architecture and how a project can be organized by developing a custom library with the core logic of the application. The project example is a persistent gallery application.

### Chapter 4, Conquering the Desktop UI
Studies the UI perspective of the model/view architecture with a Qt Widget application relying on the library completed in the previous chapter.

### Chapter 5, Dominating the Mobile UI
Adds the missing part of the gallery application with the mobile version (Android and iOS); the chapter covers it with the use of QML, Qt Quick controls, and QML / C++ interactions.

### Chapter 6, Even Qt Deserves a Slice of Raspberry Pi
Continues to the road on Qt Quick application with the Qt 3D perspective. This chapter covers how to build a 3D snake game
targeted at the Raspberry Pi.
